# ðŸ“‚ Config

This folder contains documentation about Nyah's configuration files.

Generally speaking Nyah's project configuration files are called `Nyah.json`, in the future we may provide more file types. Hmmm... Probably.

If you are a beginner, you can learn them in order.

- [Name](./Name.md)
